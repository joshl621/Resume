I started my Software Industry career with the current company as a QS Coordinator managing change requests and co-lead in the Change Control Board Meetings in the past. I have been assigned to various roles starting from QA Analyst to Software Release, Information Security and PCI Lead. After being with the company for over ten years, I am ready to transition to a new company to embark on new challenges. I have confidence that my experiences can bring great potential for any company as an individual as well as a team player.
